# Pomodoro Project

This is a project assignment from the Web Dev 101 curriculum at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The [assignment outline](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/pairing-project#assignment) is to create a Pomodoro Timer, which is a tool that can be used with the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) of time management.

This assignment is to be done in pairs, using pair programming during the entire development. The purpose of this is to learn how to pair program and see some of the benefits and obstacles that come along with it.
